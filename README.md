# - OpenVPN (LDAP) -
An Ubuntu container built with the purpose of offering a highly available LDAP backed OpenVPN server. For authentication, OpenVPN is configured to query PAM and LDAP via libpam-ldapd (nslcd) instead of OpenVPN's own LDAP module.

High availability is provided via Keepalived; a well-proven and battle-tested routing and failover service. The main reason for using Keepalived in addition to Marathon's own HA is to account for scenarios where Mesos/Marathon itself may be having issues (e.g. cluster net-splits) and access is still needed to the private Mesos-Network.

With services such as OpenVPN where a container needs to modify the host configuration to function (in this case iptables rules); Redpill provides the essential service of performing cleanup upon container termination. In the default deployment, Redpill will execute an auto generated iptables rule removal script specified via the environment variable `OVPN_IPTB_DELETE`.

##### Version Information:

* **Container Release:** 1.2.0
* **OpenVPN:** 2.3.2-7ubuntu3.1
* **Keepalived:** 1:1.2.7-1ubuntu1


##### Services Include
* **[OpenVPN](@openvpn)** - Provides network access from the public network side to the Mesos-Network.
* **[Libpam-LDAPD (nslcd)](#nslcd)** - A daemon that provides LDAP lookup and authentication for PAM.
* **[Rsyslog](#rsyslog)** - The system logging daemon. Bundled to support logging for Keepalived.
* **[Keepalived](#keepalived)** - A well known and frequently used framework that provides load-balancing and fault tolerance via VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol).
* **[Logrotate](#logrotate)** - A script and application that aid in pruning log files.
* **[Logstash-Forwarder](#logstash-forwarder)** - A lightweight log collector and shipper for use with [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash).
* **[Redpill](#redpill)** - A bash script and healthcheck for supervisord managed services. It is capable of running cleanup scripts that should be executed upon container termination.

### Usage

#### READ THIS BEFORE YOU ATTEMPT TO RUN OR BUILD

There are three important things that **MUST** be done before attempting to deploy this container: 

1. Configure the host
2. Configure ldap (`/etc/nslcd.conf`)
3. Generate OpenVPN Certificates.

##### Host Preparation
The host(s) that this is intended to run on must have a few kernel settings configured to function correctly:
 * `net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1` - For Keepalived to bind to an address that is not currently tied to a device.

 * `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1` - Allows the kernel to forward packets, needed by OpenVPN.

 Generally, these would be done to slaves that are dedicated to being the bridge between the Mesos-Network and Public-Network. It can sit alongside Bamboo/HAproxy containers on the same host without issue.

##### LDAP Preparation
`/etc/nslcd.conf`
Nslcd needs to be configured with the proper LDAP settings for your environment. After configuration, the file must have permissions set to `640`. This is done automatically in the Dockerfile, but if the configuration is being mounted from a host or other container, this will have to be done manually.

An example tailored for Active Directory is included below, for more general configuration information, please see [Arthur DeJong's documentation](http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/nslcd.conf.5).

```
uid nslcd
gid nslcd

ldap_version 3
tls_reqcert never
ignorecase yes
referrals no


uri ldaps://example.com
base dc=example,dc=com
binddn cn=authuser,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
bindpw immapassword


filter passwd (&(objectClass=user)(memberOf=cn=mesos-users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com))
map    passwd uid              sAMAccountName

filter shadow (&(objectClass=user)(memberOf=cn=mesos-users,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com))
map    shadow uid              sAMAccountName
```

##### Certificate Preparation

`/etc/openvpn/certs/*`
All the certificate information needed to run OpenVPN should be stored in `/etc/openvpn/certs/`. These can be generated easily via EasyRSA (Ubuntu has a good guide here: [OpenVPN Public Key Infrastructure Setup](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/openvpn.html#openvpn-pki-setup)) or for convenience the `mrbobbytables/easyrsa` container can be pulled/built and used. It should include:
* `ca.crt` - The Certificate Authority certificate. This will only be needed to be used once to sign the server certificate and then distributed to the clients to verify the server.

* `dh2048.pem` - The server's Diffie-Hellman key file - can be generated with `openssl dhparam -out dh2048.pem 2048`. **Note:** This can take a significant amount of time depending on your system specs.

* `server.crt` - The signed server certificate for the OpenVPN server.

* `server.key` - The private key for the OpenVPN server.

Alternate filenames and paths can be used, they just need to be passed as [environment variables](#enabled-autoconfiguration) for the init script to handle.

---

##### Deploying in Production

For a production or development deployment with [Keepalived](#keepalived) enabled. There are close to a dozen important environment variables that should be set at a minimum.

**Configuration Parameters**

* `ENVIRONMENT` - when set to `production` or `development` it will enable all services including: `openvpn`, `nslcd`, `keepalived`, `logstash-forwarder`, and `redpill`.

* `OVPN_LOCAL` - This is the IP address that OpenVPN should listen on for incoming public connections.

* `OVPN_PUSH_###` - A quoted string containing a command to be pushed to the client. In general, there should always be at least one push command that passes the route to the client e.g. `OVPN_PUSH_1="push route 10.10.0.0 255.255.255.0"`. More than one can be supplied as long as the variable name ends in a number from 0-999. Other useful things to push are internally used DNS servers (e.g. Mesos-DNS). For a full list of options, please see the OpenVPN documentation and look up the push directive.

* `OVPN_NET_###` - A network and its associated interface on the host that should be routed through OpenVPN in the form of `<INTERFACE>:<SUBNET(CIDR NOTATION)>` e.g. `OVPN_NET_1=eth0:10.10.0.0/24`. It is used to auto generate the needed iptables rules. More than one can be supplied as long as the variable name ends in a number from 0-999.

* `KEEPALIVED_INTERFACE` - The host interface that keepalived will monitor and use for VRRP traffic. e.g. `eth0`

* `KEEPALIVED_VRRP_UNICAST_BIND` - The IP on the host that the keepalived daemon should bind to. **Note:** If not specified, it will be the first IP bound to the interface specified in `$KEEPALIVED_INTERFACE`

* `KEEPALIVED_VRRP_UNICAST_PEER` - The host IP of the peer in the VRRP group (the other host acting as an edge or proxy system).

* `KEEPALIVED_TRACK_INTERFACE_###` - An interface that’s state should be monitored (e.g. `eth0`). More than one can be supplied as long as the variable name ends in a number from 0-999. 

* `KEEPALIVED_VIRTUAL_IPADDRESS_###` - An instance of an address that will be monitored and failed over from one host to another. These should be a quoted string in the form of: `<IPADDRESS>/<MASK> brd <BROADCAST_IP> dev <DEVICE> scope <SCOPE> label <LABEL>` At a minimum the ip address, mask and device should be specified e.g. `KEEPALIVED_VIRTUAL_IPADDRESS_1="10.10.0.2/24 dev eth0"`. More than one can be supplied as long as the variable name ends in a number from 0-999. Note: Keepalived has a hard limit of 20 addresses that can be monitored. More can be failed over with the monitored addresses via `KEEPALIVED_VIRTUAL_IPADDRESS_EXCLUDED_###`. In general, this would be a floating IP on the private network side, and does not have to have any true intended purpose other than being a monitored IP.

* `KEEPALIVED_VIRTUAL_IPADDRESS_EXCLUDED_###` - An instance of an address that will be failed over with the monitored addresses supplied via KEEPALIVED_VIRTUAL_IPADDRESS_###. These should be a quoted string in the form of: `<IPADDRESS>/<MASK> brd <BROADCAST_IP> dev <DEVICE> scope <SCOPE> label <LABEL>` At a minimum the ip address, mask and device should be specified e.g. `KEEPALIVED_VIRTUAL_IPADDRESS_EXCLUDED_1="172.16.1.20/24 dev eth1"`. More than one can be supplied as long as the variable name ends in a number from 0-999. This is ideal for any public facing IP addresses.

For further configuration parameters, please see either the [OpenVPN](#openvpn) or [Keepalived](#keepalived) Service sections.

### Modification and Anatomy of the Project

**File Structure**
The directory `skel` in the project root maps to the root of the file system once the container is built. Files and folders placed there will map to their corresponding location within the container.

**Init**
The init script (`./init.sh`) found at the root of the directory is the entry process for the container. It's role is to simply set specific environment variables and modify any subsequently required configuration files.

**OpenVPN**
The OpenVPN configuration is generally automatically created; however the certs and alternate configs can be placed in `/etc/openvpn/`.

**Supervisord**
All supervisord configs can be found in `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/`. Services by default will redirect their stdout to `/dev/fd/1` and stderr to `/dev/fd/2` allowing for service's console output to be displayed. Most applications can log to both stdout and their respectively specified log file.

In some cases (such as with zookeeper), it is possible to specify different logging levels and formats for each location.

**Logstash-Forwarder**
The Logstash-Forwarder binary and default configuration file can be found in `/skel/opt/logstash-forwarder`. It is ideal to bake the Logstash Server certificate into the base container at this location. If the certificate is called `logstash-forwarder.crt`, the default supplied Logstash-Forwarder config should not need to be modified, and the server setting may be passed through the `SERVICE_LOGSTASH_FORWARDER_ADDRESS` environment variable.

In practice, the supplied Logstash-Forwarder config should be used as an example to produce one tailored to each deployment.

#### Description

* `ENVIRONMENT_INIT` - If set, and the file path is valid. This will be sourced and executed before **ANYTHING** else. Useful if supplying an environment file or need to query a service such as consul to populate other variables.

* `APP_NAME` - A brief description of the container. If Logstash-Forwarder is enabled, this will populate the `app_name` field in the Logstash-Forwarder configuration file.

* `ENVIRONMENT` - Sets defaults for several other variables based on the current running environment. Please see the [environment](#environment) section for further information. If logstash-forwarder is enabled, this value will populate the `environment` field in the logstash-forwarder configuration file.

* `PARENT_HOST` - The name of the parent host. If Logstash-Forwarder is enabled, this will populate the `parent_host` field in the Logstash-Forwarder configuration file.

* `OVPN_AUTOCONF` - Enables or disables OpenVPN autoconfiguration. (**Options:** `enabled` or `disabled`) 

* `OVPN_CONF` - The path to the OpenVPN configuration file.

* `OVPN_IPTB_CREATE` - The path to the script containing the iptables rules to be executed before OpenVPN launches. This will be auto generated if `OVPN_AUTOCONF` is enabled.

* `OVPN_IPTB_DELETE` - The path to the script containing the iptables rules that should be executed upon container termination. For all intents and purposes, this should mirror the rules in the iptables creation file (`iptables -D` instead of `iptables -A`). If `OVPN_AUTOCONF` is enabled, this script will be autogenerated.

* `SERVICE_OVPN_CMD` - The command that is passed to supervisor. If overriding, must be an escaped python string expression. Please see the [Supervisord Command Documentation](http://supervisord.org/configuration.html#program-x-section-settings) for further information.

* `SERVICE_KEEPALIVED` - Enables or Disables the Keepalived service. Set automatically depending on the `ENVIRONMENT`. See the Environment section below.  (**Options:** `enabled` or `disabled`)

* `SERVICE_KEEPALIVED_CONF` - The path to keepalived config.

* `KEEPALIVED_AUTOCONF` - Enables or disables Keepalived autoconfiguration. (**Options:** `enabled` or `disabled`)

* `SERVICE_LOGROTATE` - Enables or disabled the Logrotate service. This will be set automatically depending on the environment. (**Options:** `enabled` or `disabled`)

* `SERVICE_LOGROTATE_INTERVAL` - The time in seconds between runs of logrotate or the logrotate script. The default (3600 or 1 hour) is set by default in the logrotate script automatically.

* `SERVICE_LOGSTASH_FORWARDER` - Enables or disables the Logstash-Forwarder service. Set automatically depending on the `ENVIRONMENT`. See the Environment section below.  (**Options:** `enabled` or `disabled`)

* `SERVICE_LOGSTASH_FORWARDER_CONF` - The path to the logstash-forwarder configuration.

* `SERVICE_NSLCD` - Enables or Disables LDAP lookup. There is no reason to disable this outside of manual troubleshooting within the container. (**Options:** `enabled` or `disabled`)

* `SERVICE_REDPILL` - Enables or disables the Redpill service. Set automatically depending on the `ENVIRONMENT`. See the Environment section below.  (**Options:** `enabled` or `disabled`)

* `SERVICE_REDPILL_MONITOR` - The name of the supervisord service(s) that the Redpill service check script should monitor.

* `SERVICE_REDPILL_CLEANUP` - The path to the script that will be executed upon container termination. For OpenVPN this should clear any iptables rules from the host.

* `SERVICE_RSYSLOG` - Enables of disables the rsyslog service. This is `enabled` by default and should not be disabled unless manually mananging logging.

### Logstash-Forwarder

Logstash-Forwarder is a lightweight application that collects and forwards logs to a logstash server endpoint for further processing. For more information see the [Logstash-Forwarder](https://github.com/elastic/logstash-forwarder) project.


#### Logstash-Forwarder Environment Variables

##### Defaults

| **Variable**                         | **Default**                                                                             |

| `SERVICE_LOGSTASH_FORWARDER_CONF`    | `/opt/logstash-forwarder/ovpn.conf`                                                      |
| `SERVICE_LOGSTASH_FORWARDER_ADDRESS` |                                                                                         |
| `SERVICE_LOGSTASH_FORWARDER_CERT`    |                                                                                         |
| `SERVICE_LOGSTASH_FORWARDER_CMD`     | `/opt/logstash-forwarder/logstash-forwarder -config=”$SERVICE_LOGSTASH_FORWARDER_CONF”` |

##### Description

* `SERVICE_LOGSTASH_FORWARDER` - Enables or disables the Logstash-Forwarder service. Set automatically depending on the `ENVIRONMENT`. See the Environment section.  (**Options:** `enabled` or `disabled`)

* `SERVICE_LOGSTASH_FORWARDER_CONF` - The path to the logstash-forwarder configuration.

* `SERVICE_LOGSTASH_FORWARDER_ADDRESS` - The address of the Logstash server.

* `SERVICE_LOGSTASH_FORWARDER_CERT` - The path to the Logstash-Forwarder server certificate.

* `SERVICE_LOGSTASH_FORWARDER_CMD` - The command that is passed to supervisor. If overriding, must be an escaped python string expression. Please see the [Supervisord Command Documentation](http://supervisord.org/configuration.html#program-x-section-settings) for further information.

### Redpill

Redpill is a small script that performs status checks on services managed through supervisor. In the event of a failed service (FATAL) Redpill optionally runs a cleanup script and then terminates the parent supervisor process.


#### Redpill Environment Variables

##### Defaults

| **Variable**               | **Default**               |
|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `SERVICE_REDPILL`          |                           |
| `SERVICE_REDPILL_MONITOR`  | `ovpn,nslcd,keepalived`   |
| `SERVICE_REDPILL_INTERVAL` |                           |
| `SERVICE_REDPILL_CLEANUP`  | `$IPTB_DELETE`            |

##### Description

* `SERVICE_REDPILL` - Enables or disables the Redpill service. Set automatically depending on the `ENVIRONMENT`. See the Environment section.  (**Options:** `enabled` or `disabled`)

* `SERVICE_REDPILL_MONITOR` - The name of the supervisord service(s) that the Redpill service check script should monitor.

* `SERVICE_REDPILL_INTERVAL` - The interval in which Redpill polls supervisor for status checks. (Default for the script is 30 seconds)

* `SERVICE_REDPILL_CLEANUP` - The path to the script that will be executed upon container termination. For OpenVPN this should clear any iptables rules from the host.


##### Redpill Script Help Text
```
root@c90c98ae31e1:/# /opt/scripts/redpill.sh --help
Redpill - Supervisor status monitor. Terminates the supervisor process if any specified service enters a FATAL state.

-c | --cleanup    Optional path to cleanup script that should be executed upon exit.
-h | --help       This help text.
-i | --interval   Optional interval at which the service check is performed in seconds. (Default: 30)
-s | --service    A comma delimited list of the supervisor service names that should be monitored.
```

### Troubleshooting

##### General Issues
In the event of an issue, the `ENVIRONMENT` variable can be set to `debug` to stop the container from shipping logs and terminating in the event of a fatal error (**Note:** This will also prevent the iptables cleanup script from executing automatically). This will also automatically set the log verbosity to it's max value of `11`. In many cases this may be too high and suggest overriding it, starting it with something smaller. Below is a snippet on logging levels from the [OpenVPN Documentation](https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Openvpn23ManPage).
```
0 -- No output except fatal errors.
1 to 4 -- Normal usage range.
5 -- Output R and W characters to the console for each packet read and write, uppercase is used for TCP/UDP packets and lowercase is used for TUN/TAP packets.
6 to 11 -- Debug info range (see errlevel.h for additional information on debug levels).
```

##### Authentication Issues
For troubleshooting authentication issues, you may wish to leave the `ENVIRONMENT` setting on `prod` or `local`, and set `SERVICE_NSLCD` to `disabled` and launching it manually by executing it via docker exec: `docker exec -it <CONTAINERNAME> /usr/sbin/nslcd -d`. This will allow you to watch the output directly from nslcd as it tries to communicate with your ldap service.
